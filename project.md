# Team Organization

Although it was of extreme interest to all the team members to be able to have **contact** with [**each of the proposed technologies**](tech.html), given the high level of **complexity** of the project as well as its **extension**, and taking into account the **little time** available to carry it out, we decided to perform an **assignment of components and responsibilities**.

In a first stage, the **different components of the system were identified**, at the same time that the **architecture** to be used was **designed**. This process was carried out with **participation of all members**. Once this was completed, we followed with the _assignment stage_.

When dividing development tasks and system components, we took into account **personal interest** rather than **experience**, as we believe that this assignment presented a very good opportunity to **learn**. The division was as follows:

| Team Member       | System component(s)                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Mauro Parafati    | `Backend microservices`, `Mobile`               |
| Nicol치s Aguerre   | `Mobile`                                        |
| Santiago Klein    | `Backend microservices`, `Smart Contracts`      |
| Taiel Colavecchia | `Backoffice web`, `API Keys`, `Smart Contracts` |
| Yuhong Huang      | `Backoffice web`                                |

In any case, throughout the project all members were able to **contribute their points of view** and **perspective** regarding the work carried out by others, allowing **constant improvement**.

We are very happy with the final division of the project, as we all felt that we learned **a lot** about things that interest us in depth.
